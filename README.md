# Introduction
This repository contains my project for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module which forms part of the ATU Galway HDIP in Data Analytics.   
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks. Tasks.ipynb contains my work completed on the tasks assigned throughout the module. Project.ipynb contains the research & analysis I conducted on the famous Iris Flower Dataset.


# Technical Requirements
## To download this Work
1. Go to my repository on Github at https://github.com/rebeccaf1918/FundamentalsOfDA
2. From there, you can choose how to use the repository whether that is downloading it as a zipfile or cloning the repository.  

## Requirements to run the code
This code is written in Python programming language in a Jupyter notebook and there are a few requirments necessary for the operate of the project code.
1. Install Python - latest version 3.11.0 
2. Install the Visual Studio Code (or your preferred source code editor)  
3. Install Cmder (or your preferred command line interpreter)  
4. Install all the Python libraries required  

  
## Requirements & Instructions  
In order to complete my work, I imported the libraries required to view and manipulate the data:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a very useful library for analysing and manipulating data and making a dataset readable.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used for creating visualisations in Python from boxplots to scatterplots. 
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) is short for 'Numerical Python' and is useful when working with number arrays.
- [Sys](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sys-module/) has many helpful features for creating Python code including facilitating command line arguments to be passed to a script.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction) is built on top of Matplotlib for creating statisical visualisations, with added features.
