While some may propose assigning numerical values to each category, such as 1 for Biscoe, 2 for Dream, I would not recommend this approach as these assigned numerical values may get confused with actual numerical data with which arithemtic can be performed. Also, it increases the likelihood of an error in the Python code as the values assigned to the species must be consistent throughout the code. While the Sex variable slightly differs in that there is only 1 of 2 possibilities (i.e it is dichotomous) and so it could be stored as a bool data type, I think that it is better to keep a more uniform approach to the nominal data and so it should be stored as a string. This will help prevent errors in the code.\n",
