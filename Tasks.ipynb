They hold no numerical value through which they can be ranked. Rather, the variables can only be sorted by category. Examples include car brands, gender, and hair colour. \n",

    "- Quantitiative data, is also known as numerical data. This is data which can be quantified, i.e it has an intrinsic numerical value through which it can be measured. Thus, numerical data can be expressed in numbers and thus ranked. \n",

    "\n",
    "The above 2 classifications can be futher separated into 4 sub-types of data: nominal, ordinal, discrete and continuous data.\n",

    "Nominal data is a subset of qualitative data. It contains variables which do not have an intrinsic value through which they can be ranked or ordered. They are not quantifiable and cannot be measured numerically. \n",
    "For example, hair colour does not have naturally have a numerical value through which it can be ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal data is also a subset of qualitative data. It contains variables which are in an order (or sequence) due to the relation amongst the different categories i.e they have a natural ordering on a scale but stil maintain their class of value. This differentiates it to nominal data.\n",
    "However, ordinal data does not have a numerical value and so while it can be assigned a number in order to show its position, it cannot be used to do arithimetic. For example, the top three finishers in a marathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete data is a subset of quantitative data. It contains variables which are numerical, but only includes integers which have a limited possible amount of values. They cannot be further divided into smaller parts. \n",
    "A clear example of this is the days of the month. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continous data is also a subset of quantitative data. It contains variables which can be broken down into even smaller values. It does not have to be only integers, as is the case with discrete data. An example includes weight of humans, which can be broken down to its fractional value.\n",

While some may propose assigning numerical values to each category, such as 1 for Biscoe, 2 for Dream, I would not recommend this approach as these assigned numerical values may get confused with actual numerical data with which arithemtic can be performed. Also, it increases the likelihood of an error in the Python code as the values assigned to the species must be consistent throughout the code. While the Sex variable slightly differs in that there is only 1 of 2 possibilities (i.e it is dichotomous) and so it could be stored as a bool data type, I think that it is better to keep a more uniform approach to the nominal data and so it should be stored as a string. This will help prevent errors in the code.\n",

    "The Bill Length, Bill Depth, Flipper Length and Body Mass variables should be stored as floats in Python as they are continous quantitative data and so their measurements will need to be very precise, to the exact millimeter.
